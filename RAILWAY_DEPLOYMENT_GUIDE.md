- `${{Redis.REDIS_URL}}` - References Redis URL
- `${{Railway.ENVIRONMENT}}` - Current environment
- `${{Railway.REGION}}` - Deployment region

---

## Step 6: Run Database Migrations

### Option A: Using Railway CLI

```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm i -g @railway/cli

# Login
railway login

# Link to your project
railway link

# Run migrations
railway run node server/migrations/migrate.js
```

### Option B: Using Railway Dashboard

1. Go to your service â†’ "Settings" â†’ "Deployments"
2. Find the latest deployment
3. Click "View Logs"
4. You should see migration logs automatically running on startup

**OR** add a deploy hook to package.json:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node server/migrations/migrate.js && node server/index.js"
  }
}
```

---

## Step 7: Deploy!

### Automatic Deployment

Railway automatically deploys when you push to your GitHub repository's main branch.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Production-ready deployment"
git push origin main
```

### Manual Deployment

In Railway Dashboard:
1. Go to your service
2. Click "Deploy" â†’ "Redeploy"

---

## Step 8: Verify Deployment

### Check Service Health

Visit your deployment URL + `/health`:
```
https://your-app.railway.app/health
```

Should return:
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-25T...",
  "uptime": 123.45,
  "services": {
    "database": "connected",
    "redis": "connected",
    "fileSystem": "ok"
  }
}
```

### Check Logs

1. Go to your service
2. Click "Logs" tab
3. Look for:
   - âœ… "PostgreSQL clients connected successfully"
   - âœ… "Redis clients connected successfully"
   - âœ… "Server running on port 5000"

---

## Step 9: Database Seeding (Optional)

If you want to add sample data:

```bash
railway run npm run seed
```

Or add seed data via SQL in Railway's PostgreSQL dashboard.

---

## Step 10: Custom Domain (Optional)

1. Go to your service â†’ "Settings" â†’ "Domains"
2. Click "Add Custom Domain"
3. Enter your domain (e.g., `biolab.yourdomain.com`)
4. Add the CNAME record to your DNS provider:
   - Name: `biolab`
   - Value: `your-app.railway.app`
5. Wait for DNS propagation (5-30 minutes)

---

## Environment-Specific Configuration

### Development
```env
NODE_ENV=development
LOG_LEVEL=debug
```

### Staging
```env
NODE_ENV=staging
LOG_LEVEL=info
```

### Production
```env
NODE_ENV=production
LOG_LEVEL=warn
```

---

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### View Metrics

Railway Dashboard â†’ Service â†’ "Metrics" tab shows:
- CPU usage
- Memory usage
- Network traffic
- Request rate

### View Logs

```bash
# Using Railway CLI
railway logs

# Or in dashboard
Service â†’ "Logs" tab
```

### Database Backups

PostgreSQL backups are automatic on Railway:
- Point-in-time recovery available
- 7-day retention on free tier
- 30-day retention on pro tier

### Redis Persistence

Redis on Railway is configured with:
- AOF (Append Only File) enabled
- Automatic snapshots every 60 seconds

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Database Connection Fails

**Solution:**
1. Check `DATABASE_URL` is set correctly
2. Verify PostgreSQL service is running
3. Check firewall rules (Railway handles this automatically)
4. Look for connection errors in logs

### Issue: Redis Connection Fails

**Solution:**
1. Check `REDIS_URL` is set correctly
2. Verify Redis service is running
3. Check if Redis password is required

### Issue: File Uploads Not Persisting

**Solution:**
1. Ensure Volume is mounted at `/app/uploads`
2. Check `UPLOAD_DIR` environment variable
3. Verify write permissions

### Issue: Out of Memory

**Solution:**
1. Upgrade to larger Railway plan
2. Optimize image processing (reduce Sharp quality)
3. Enable Redis cache for frequently accessed data
4. Implement pagination for large datasets

### Issue: Slow Performance

**Solution:**
1. Enable Redis caching
2. Add database indexes
3. Optimize queries (use EXPLAIN ANALYZE)
4. Enable connection pooling (already configured)
5. Use CDN for static assets

---

## Scaling

### Horizontal Scaling

Railway supports horizontal scaling on Pro plans:

1. Go to Service â†’ "Settings" â†’ "Scaling"
2. Increase "Replicas" count
3. Railway will load balance across instances

### Vertical Scaling

Upgrade your Railway plan for more resources:
- **Starter**: 512MB RAM, 0.5 vCPU
- **Pro**: Up to 32GB RAM, 32 vCPU

---

## Cost Optimization

### Free Tier Limits
- $5/month free credit
- All services count toward usage
- â‰ˆ 500 hours of runtime/month

### Tips to Reduce Costs
1. Use shared PostgreSQL/Redis instead of dedicated
2. Implement aggressive caching
3. Optimize image sizes before upload
4. Clean up old logs and files
5. Use Railway's sleep mode for development

---

## Security Checklist

- âœ… Strong JWT_SECRET (min 32 characters)
- âœ… Different SESSION_SECRET
- âœ… HTTPS enabled (automatic on Railway)
- âœ… Environment variables secured
- âœ… CORS configured correctly
- âœ… Rate limiting enabled
- âœ… SQL injection protection (parameterized queries)
- âœ… File upload validation
- âœ… Helmet.js security headers
- âœ… Password hashing with bcrypt

---

## Backup Strategy

### PostgreSQL Backups

```bash
# Manual backup
railway run pg_dump $DATABASE_URL > backup.sql

# Restore from backup
railway run psql $DATABASE_URL < backup.sql
```

### File Uploads Backup

Since files are in a Volume:
1. Download files via SFTP (Railway provides access)
2. Or implement S3/Cloudinary for file storage
3. Set up automated backups to cloud storage

### Redis Backup

Redis data is volatile - important data should be in PostgreSQL.
For critical cache data:
1. Enable AOF persistence
2. Export data periodically

---

## Rollback Procedure

### Option 1: Redeploy Previous Version

1. Go to Service â†’ "Deployments"
2. Find previous successful deployment
3. Click "..." â†’ "Redeploy"

### Option 2: Git Rollback

```bash
# Revert to previous commit
git revert HEAD
git push origin main

# Or reset to specific commit
git reset --hard <commit-hash>
git push origin main --force
```

---

## Performance Benchmarks

Expected performance on Railway Starter plan:

- **API Response Time**: < 100ms (cached)
- **API Response Time**: < 500ms (database query)
